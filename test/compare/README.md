## Comparisons

This directory is for comparing other WebSocket clients to Mint.

### Gun

After the merging of
[#17](https://github.com/NFIBrokerage/mint_web_socket/pull/17),
Mint.WebSocket is pretty comparable performance and conformance-wise to
[`ninenines/gun`](https://github.com/ninenines/gun).

See the comparison Autobahn|Testsuite report
[here](https://mint-websocket.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/compare/gun/index.html).

The gun implementation is included in the `./gun` subdirectory.
